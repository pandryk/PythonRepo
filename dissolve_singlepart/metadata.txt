about=Existing QGIS Dissolve functions allow dissolving objects based on shared attribute. As a result you receive a new layer with multipart objects. Dissolve Singlepart plugin dissolves only connected objects. Thus, as a result you receive a layer with singlepart objects. However, you can obtain a similar result, by using Dissolve, and then Multipart to Singlepart, you would lose unique attributes of dissolved objects. Dissolve Singlepart solves that problem.
